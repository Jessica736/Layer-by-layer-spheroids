# Layer-by-layer-spheroids

Spatial transcriptomics techniques have been widely used to map the spatial organisation of multiple cell types within tissue sections. 
Here, we use transient transfection to label cells within 3D cell cultures with DNA barcodes that are compatible with multiplexed single-cell RNA sequencing.  
Therefore, we can collect spatially relevant transcriptomics information at the single-cell level. 
We demonstrate that this method can be used to construct 3D spheroids layer-by-layer to map drug response and mechanical heterogeneity. 
Here the code used to generate the figures in our paper is presented.
